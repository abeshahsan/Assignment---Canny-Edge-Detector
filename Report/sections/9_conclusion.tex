In this assignment, the Canny Edge Detection algorithm was implemented to identify edges in digital images effectively. The process involved applying Gaussian smoothing to reduce noise, calculating intensity gradients, and using non-maximum suppression to refine edge detection. Double thresholding and edge tracking by hysteresis were employed to produce the final edge map.

The results demonstrated the algorithm's ability to detect edges with high accuracy while minimizing noise and false detections. The findings highlight the importance of parameter tuning, such as the thresholds and Gaussian kernel size, in achieving optimal performance. Overall, the implementation validated the robustness and efficiency of the Canny Edge Detector in edge detection tasks.
